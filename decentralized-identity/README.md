# Sudo Decentralized Identity Sample App

## Overview
This project provides examples for interacting with the [Sudo Decentralized Identity iOS SDK](https://github.com/sudoplatform/sudo-decentralized-identity-ios) on the [Sudo Platform](https://sudoplatform.com/).

## Version Support
| Technology             | Supported version |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| iOS Deployment Target  | 13.2+             |
| Swift language version | 5.0               |
| Xcode version          | 11.2+             |

## Getting Started
1. Run `pod install` from the project root.
2. Open `DecentralizedIdentityExample.xcworkspace` in Xcode.
3. If building to a physical device, select a Development Team in Project Settings > DecentralizedIdentityExample target > Signing & Capabilities.
4. Run the app.
  - *Note:* When running the app on a physical device for the first time, you will be instructed to trust your developer account in the iOS settings app.
  - *Note:* Due to a bug only present in iOS 13.3.1, running the app on a physical device without a paid developer account will display a linker error at runtime. To avoid this, run the app on a device with iOS 13.3.0 or iOS 13.4+.

### Using the App
1. Tap the "Getting Started" button to create a new wallet and view an (initially empty) list of pairwise connections.
2. From the wallet screen, tap the "Create Pairwise Connection" button.
3. On this device, select "Create Invitation". Provide a label that will be used to identify this device.
4. On a second device, select "Scan Invitation".
  1. Provide a label that will identify this second device.
  2. Scan the QR code that was generated by the first device.
5. A pairwise connection will then be negotiated between the two devices.
6. Selecting this pairwise connection from the connection list will display a list of chat messages between the devices, and allow composing new messages.
